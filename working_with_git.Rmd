## Setting up this talk 

### Credit where credit is due:

All of my meaningful progress in git is thanks to this invaluable resource:




## What is git?

- why are you doing this to me
- I'm just trying to learn R here
- don't make me think about file structures and code

## how do you back up your work?

- what if your laptop goes missing?
- what if you accidentally delete your H:?
- what if you save over code that worked with broken crummy code??

## How do you share your work?

- What if you keep doign the same thigns over and over again?
- what if the person after you is going to have to do the same things over and over again
- how do we share code and make it work? In our organization? with collaborators outside?
